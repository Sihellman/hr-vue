This a human resource application to manage a database of employees, jobs, and competencies, with an API. 
#
I have not yet developed the CSS and pagination. 
#
The folder to_be_put_in_htdocs contains the API, the schema, and the htaccess to be put in the htdocs folder of XAMPP. 
#
The src/views contains the webpages I made.
